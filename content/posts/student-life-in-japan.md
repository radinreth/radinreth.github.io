Receiving a MEXT scholarship is a dream!

I graduated BS in Computer Science in 2013, since then I work as a software developer for about 10 years before applying for a scholarship. The process to apply for MEXT is not too complicated but you must pay attention detail in the scholarship guideline, if you miss a single step may cause big problem. If you want to apply this scholarship I encourage you take time to read the scholarship guideline, highlight important things you need to do and convert into step by step activities to make sure you never missing any important step.

you have to submit some important documents required by the embassy.

for me, I have only one chance to pass if not, I will lost the scholarship and have to return back.

I arrived Kyushu and took JTAS course for about 4 months from 1 oct 2023 to 2 feb 2024,

prepare for math and specialize test

in 2024, around 20-25% of all the candidates passed the entrance.

I learn a lot of things
